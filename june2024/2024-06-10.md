## Debugging
- Add the gem to your Gemfile:
- `gem 'debug', group: :development`
- Run `bundle install` to install the gem.
- In Ruby, `binding.break` is a method used to initiate a debugging session. However, there’s a more commonly used alias: `debugger`.
# Navigating the debugging Session
- When your Rails server hits the debugger line, it will pause, and you’ll enter the debug mode in your console. Here’s how to navigate:
- `step` or `s`: Move to the next line of code, stepping into methods.
- `next` or `n`: Move to the next line without stepping into methods.
- `continue` or `c`: Resume normal execution until the next breakpoint.
- `vars`: Display local variables and their values.
- `p <expression>:` Evaluate and print any Ruby expression.
# Advanced Debugging Techniques
- Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that trigger under specific conditions, like `debugger if params[:debug].`
- Watching Variables: Use `watch @post` to monitor changes in the @post variable.
- Backtrace Inspection: Use `backtrace` to view the call stack and understand how the code reached the current point.
