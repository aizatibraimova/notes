## Keeping things simple
- Where is the required information coming from? (API, )
- Is my domain model correct?
- Is my database architecture correct - i.e. are our tables and columns sufficient
- Are we solving the right problem, or is an adjacent one more pressing?
- Whos is your user?(I am the user)
- Can we develop some key personas?
- What assumptions are we making about our users?
