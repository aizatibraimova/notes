## BiteBuddy Functional Specifications

- **BiteBuddy**: A platform designed to help caregivers log their child's meals and allergic reactions, providing tools to monitor and identify potential food allergies. The platform leverages AI to analyze data, ensuring informed decision-making for the safety and well-being of infants and toddlers.
- **Ensuring safe meals, one bite at a time.**

## Pain Points
- Monitoring and identifying a child‚Äôs food allergies can be complex and time-consuming, with caregivers needing a reliable system to track meals and reactions over time.
- Correlating allergic reactions with specific foods without systematic data logging and analysis can lead to missed patterns, potentially putting a child's health at risk.

## Proposed Solution
- BiteBuddy offers a centralized platform where caregivers can log meals and allergic reactions independently. The platform provides an AI-driven analysis that helps caregivers identify potential correlations between foods and allergic reactions, enabling proactive allergy management.

## Key Features
1. **User Management**: Secure user sign-up, login, and profile management features.
2. **Child Management**: Ability to add, update, and manage multiple children‚Äôs profiles within a single user account.
3. **Meal Logging**: Functionality to log meals with details like food type, quantity, and time.
4. **Allergy Logging**: Capability to log allergic reactions with details such as symptoms, severity, and time of occurrence.
5. **Food Management**: Users can add, update, and categorize new foods they plan to introduce to their child.
6. **AI Analysis**: Optional AI-driven analysis that correlates logged meals and allergic reactions to identify potential food allergens.
7. **Security**: Implementation of secure data storage, ensuring that all user data, including meal logs and allergic reactions, is protected.

## User Stories
### MVP
- As a user, I want to create and manage a profile for each of my children, so that I can track their individual dietary habits and allergies.
- As a user, I want to log the food my child consumes, so that I can track their diet and identify any food-related issues.

## Associations

- **User has_many Children**: Each user can have multiple children profiles under their account.
- **Child belongs_to User**: Each child is associated with a single user (caregiver).
- **Child has_many FoodLogs**: Each child can have multiple meal logs.
- **Child has_many Allergies**: Each child can have multiple allergic reactions recorded.
- **FoodLog belongs_to Child and Food**: Each meal log is associated with one child and one food item.
- **Allergy belongs_to Child**: Each allergic reaction is associated with one child.
- **Analysis belongs_to Child**: Each analysis is associated with one child and uses data from their logged meals and allergies.

## Hypothesis

- **Hypothesis**: By providing caregivers with a platform to systematically log meals and allergic reactions, combined with AI-driven analysis, caregivers will be better equipped to identify potential food allergies in their children, leading to more informed and proactive management of their child's diet and health.
- **Testing**: The hypothesis will be tested by tracking user engagement with the logging features and measuring the accuracy and usefulness of the AI-driven insights. User feedback will also be gathered to evaluate the effectiveness of the platform in helping caregivers manage their child's food allergies.

## Target User Persona
